## Description
The **Road Call Service Form** is a dynamic, multi-step web application designed to streamline the process of collecting and reporting breakdown information for transportation and trucking operations. The project allows users to efficiently capture key details such as:

- **Company Information:** Including specialized fields for FedEx and "Other" companies.
- **Caller Details:** Name and phone number of the person reporting the breakdown.
- **Driver & Vehicle Information:** Driver’s name, truck and trailer details, and mileage/VIN.
- **Breakdown Specifics:** A brief complaint description, tire-related breakdown questions, damage details, and additional load details (such as load number and weight).
- **Location Details:** Address, city, state, and reference points.

Based on the user’s input, the form dynamically reveals only the relevant fields. Once the form is complete, the application generates a neatly formatted HTML table report that includes a custom email subject line—composed from key form responses (e.g., RC#, Company, Unit Type/Number, Complaint, City, and State). This report can be easily copied to the clipboard and pasted into an email client, ensuring that all required information is presented in a consistent and legible format.

The project features a responsive design using Bootstrap 5, which includes:

- A fixed header with logos and a mobile-responsive navigation menu.
- A hero image carousel.
- A multi-step form that adapts dynamically based on user selections.
- A footer that mimics corporate branding, with location links and company logos.

Overall, the Road Call Service Form is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is intended to improve data entry accuracy, streamline reporting processes, and ensure consistent communication for road call events.
